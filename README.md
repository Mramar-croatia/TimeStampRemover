# Whatsapp Transcript Datanalyzer

 The program is used to analyze the data from Whatsapp chat exports in the form of .txt files. It displays data about the message amount through time, amount of messages sent by different users, average message length, amount of media files sent by each user, most commonly used words, amount of messages sent, and other things related to the chat. All this data is shown trough graphs made in Matplotlib.

 The requirements.txt file contains all the requirements.

The only thing that needs to be done is cloning this repository, placing your .txt export of a WhatsApp chat (made by exporting from WhatsApp) in the folder and running main.py in an interactive terminal. All the graphs and data will be stored in the "RESULTS" folder.
